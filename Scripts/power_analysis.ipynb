    "\n",
    "### Core Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical power is simply the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when a true effect exists. Simulation makes this concrete: generate fake experiments where you *know* the treatment works, then measure how often your statistical test catches it.\n",

    "### The Three-Step Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Simulate data under the alternative hypothesis** - Generate datasets where treatment genuinely lifts conversion (from 1.29% to 1.3545%)\n",

    "### Null vs. Alternative Hypothesis Simulations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Under the null hypothesis**: Both control and treatment have identical conversion rates (both at 1.29%). This establishes your Type I error rate—the false positive rate. When you run thousands of simulations under the null and count how often p < 0.05, you should get approximately 5% rejections.\n",

It addresses a key question: **\"How many simulations do I need for a precise power estimate?\"**\n\n### The Trade-off\n\nMore simulations → More precision → Longer computation time\n\nWith bootstrap simulation, your power estimate itself has sampling variability. The standard error of a power estimate is:\n\n**SE = √[power × (1 - power) / n_simulations]**\n\nFor example, with 80% power:\n- **100 simulations**: SE ≈ 0.040 (±8% at 95% CI)\n- **1,000 simulations**: SE ≈ 0.013 (±2.5%)\n- **5,000 simulations**: SE ≈ 0.006 (±1.2%)\n- **10,000 simulations**: SE ≈ 0.004 (±0.8%)\n\n### What This Plot Shows\n\nWe'll fix the sample size at **492,000 per group** (known to achieve ~80% power from analytical calculation) and run simulations with increasing simulation counts. The plot will show:\n- How power estimates bounce around with few simulations\n- How they converge to the true analytical power (~0.80) as simulations increase\n- Confidence bands showing expected variability\n\nThis helps you choose an appropriate number of simulations: enough for precision, but not wastefully many.",

   "source": "## Visualization 3: Distribution of Observed Effect Sizes\n\nThis visualization reveals the **sampling variability** in observed effect sizes across repeated experiments. Even when the true treatment effect is fixed, each individual experiment will observe a slightly different effect size due to random chance.\n\n### Why This Matters\n\nWhen you run a real A/B test, you only get **one** observation of the effect size. This single observation comes from a probability distribution centered around the true effect. Understanding this distribution helps you:\n- Appreciate why large samples are needed for small effects\n- Understand confidence intervals intuitively\n- Recognize that observed effects can differ from true effects\n\n### The Sampling Distribution\n\nAccording to the **Central Limit Theorem**, the distribution of observed effect sizes (p_treatment - p_control) follows a normal distribution with:\n- **Mean**: True effect (0.0645 percentage points, or 5% relative lift)\n- **Standard Error**: √[(p1(1-p1) + p2(1-p2)) / n]\n\n### What This Plot Shows\n\nWe'll run 5,000 simulations at our target sample size (492,000 per group) and collect the observed effect sizes. The histogram will show:\n- The spread of possible effect sizes you might observe\n- How the distribution centers on the true effect\n- The 95% confidence interval for effect size estimates\n- Why even with perfect power (80%), individual experiments vary\n\nThis demonstrates a fundamental principle: **even with adequate sample size, individual experiments give slightly different results due to randomness**.",
